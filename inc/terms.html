            <h2>Editorial policies</h2>
        
        <h2>Community guidelines</h2>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">These guidelines mainly apply to the YouTube comments.</p>
            <p>If you are offered the ability to submit user-generated content to the website or its associated social media channels, it must not consist of any content outlined in these guidelines.</p>

            <h3>Illegal content</h3>
            <p>Content which is or would be illegal to distribute under the law of the Australian Capital Territory will not be accepted. Content which risks creating an unacceptable burden of legal liability will also not be accepted.</p>
            <p>This includes, among other things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the unauthorised dissemination of personally identifiable information that would not otherwise be public;</li>
                <li>the unauthorised distribution of copyrighted material, unless justifiable under fair dealing exceptions;</li>
                <li>content that has or would likely be refused classification by the Australian Classification Board or Classification Review Board;</li>
                <li>content which appears to or intends to incite people to commit criminal offences;</li>
                <li>content which appears to or intends to incite support for <a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/what-australia-is-doing/terrorist-organisations">certain proscribed organisations</a>.</li>
                <li>content intended to "menace, harass, or cause offence".</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>If necessary, illegal content will be reported to the relevant authorities.</strong>

            <h3>Hate speech</h3>
            <p>Content which constitutes hate speech will not be accepted.</p>
            <p><i>Hate speech</i> comprises any expression which tends to harass, intimidate, or offend a person or group of people based on an immutable characteristic that the group shares.</p>
            <h4 style="font-style: italic;">What is an immutable characteristic?</h4>
            <p>An <i>immutable characteristic</i> is (generally speaking) a characteristic about a person that they cannot change or should not be expected to change in a society that upholds individual freedom. These include, but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>sex or gender;</li>
                    <li>race, skin colour, or ethnicity;</li>
                    <li>religious belief, including irreligion (such as atheism);</li>
                    <li>sexual or romantic orientation;</li>
                    <li>nationality, country of origin, citizenship status, or statelessness;</li>
                    <li>having a disability or chronic disease;</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Under the law of the Australian Capital Territory, "serious vilification" on a number of grounds in the context of a "threatening act" is a serious criminal offence and such acts may be reported to authorities.</p>

            <p>As rule of thumb, if you are attacking a person and not their ideas, you are likely using hate speech.</p>

            <h3>Spam</h3>
            <p>Spam is any irrelevant and/or repeitive content sent without solicitation. If you are submitting content which isn't relevant to the website, or you are copy-pasting the same content over and over, it may be marked as spam.</p>

            <strong>Consistent spam may result in your IP address being blocked from accessing the website, which may inconvinience users other than yourself, or result your relevant account being blocked from the relevant social media page.</strong>

            <h3>Toxic or trolling behaviour</h3>
            If your submission appears to exist solely to troll people or cause drama, it will be rejected.

            <h3>Guidelines not binding or exhaustive</h3>
            I reserve the right to reject user-generated content for any reason, including a reason not listed in these guidelines.
